Ensure that you have these tools installed and configured on your system before proceeding with the project. Having these tools in place will enable you to work seamlessly with Spring Boot, MySQL, and Postman.

#4. STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:
#a. Setting Up Spring Boot Project:
=>	Download and Install Spring Tools Suite (STS). (Refer 3.a)
=>	Create a New Spring Boot Project using Spring Initializer.
		Website: https://start.spring.io/
Give Project-> Maven
=>	Choose Project Dependencies and Configuration.
For this project add dependencies:
	*Spring Boot DevTools: For efficient development and automatic application restart.
	*Spring Web: For building web applications.
	*Spring Data JPA: For data access with JPA.Leave all the other as default.
=>	Explore the Project Structure.
=>	Give Generate.
=>	Import the generated project into Spring Tools Suite.
=>	Click "File" > "Import" > "Existing Maven Projects" to import the project into your IDE.
=>	STS will download the required dependencies and set up the project for you.

For me:
Group: com.fazly
Artifact: springbasics
Package: com.fazly.springbasics:

#b.  Creating Model Classes:
=>	Open the project springbasics in Spring Tool Suite
=>	Locate default package com.fazly.springbasics inside src/main/java
=>	Inside src/main/java create a package com.fazly.springbasics.model to create model classes:
	*Users.java 
	*Department.java
=>	Open each model class and add JPA annotations. For example, you might use @Entity to specify that the class is an entity, and @Table to define the table name.
=>	Inside each model class, define the fields and methods that represent the attributes and behavior of the data. 
=>	User class may have fields for id, name, email, and password use @Id to specify primary key.
=>	Department class may have fields for id, name and section use @Id to specify primary key.
=>	Give constructors, getters and setters methods for both the Model Classes. 
	->The @GeneratedValue annotation with the strategy of GenerationType.UUID is used to specify how the primary key of an entity should be generated. In the context of JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate, this annotation is often used to generate unique identifiers for database records.
	->@GeneratedValue: This annotation marks a field in your entity class as an auto-generated value for the primary key. It indicates that the value of this field should be generated by the database or the JPA provider (e.g., Hibernate) and not explicitly set by the application.
	->strategy = GenerationType.UUID: This part specifies the strategy for generating the primary key. In this case, UUID stands for universally unique identifier. A UUID is a 128-bit identifier that is guaranteed to be unique across time and space.

#c. Configuring MySQL Database:
=>	Create the MySQL Database Schema: Use MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client to create the ‘springbasics’ schema in your MySQL database. You'll need to do this manually.
=>	Open the application.properties File: Locate the application.properties file in your Spring Boot project. This file is typically located in the src/main/resources directory.

#d. Creating Repository Interfaces:
=>	Inside src/main/java create package com.fazly.springbasics.repository and in this package create interfaces called UserRepository and DepartmentRepository.
=>	Extend JpaRepository<EntityClass, ID> where EntityClass is the entity class (User or Department) and ID is the type of the entity's primary key (String).

#e. Creating Service Classes:
=>	Inside src/main/java create package com.fazly.springbasics.service and in this package create classes called UserService and DepartmentService.
=>	In your service class, add the @Service annotation to indicate that it's a Spring service component.
=>	Use @Autowired to inject the corresponding repository interface. This allows your service class to access data through the repository.
=>	Implement the business logic of your service class. This logic can include tasks such as data validation, data transformation, or any custom operations related to the entity you're working with.

#f. Creating Controller Classes:
=>	Inside src/main/java create package com.fazly.springbasics.controller and in this package create classes called UserController and DepartmentController.
=>	In your controller class, add the @RestController annotation to indicate that it's a Spring controller.
=>	Use @RequestMapping or other mapping annotations to define the request mappings (endpoints) that this controller will handle. These annotations specify the URL paths for the controller's methods.
=>	Use @Autowired to inject the corresponding service classes. This allows your controller to interact with the service layer.
=>	Create methods in your controller to handle specific HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). These methods can use @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, or @DeleteMapping annotations to specify the HTTP method and URL path.
UserController.java:

#g. Testing with Postman:
=>	Launch Postman from your computer. Create your own account.
=>	In Postman, click the "New" button to create a new request.
=>	Give your request a name to help identify it.
=>	Choose the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) based on the endpoint you want to test.
=>	In the request URL field, enter the URL of the endpoint you want to test. For example, if you want to test a GET request to retrieve all users, enter the URL like http://localhost:8181/api/v1/user/get.

For Example,
1.	POST	http://localhost:8181/api/v1/user/hello
2.	GET	http://localhost:8181/api/v1/user/get
{
   	 "name":"{{$randomFullName}}",
 "email":"{{$randomEmail}}",
 "password":"{{$randomPassword}}"
    }
3.	POST	http://localhost:8181/api/v1/user/save
To execute these, give Send Request.
Then for Department also follow the same.
    

#5. CONCLUSION:
	In this, we have explored the process of building a Spring Boot project with MySQL and Postman integration. Here are the key takeaways:
Setting Up Spring Boot Project: We started by creating a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializer, configuring the project dependencies, and exploring the project structure.
Configuring MySQL Database: Before configuring our Spring Boot application, we created a MySQL database schema and configured the application.properties file to connect to the database.
Creating Repository Interfaces: We defined repository interfaces for our entity classes, enabling data access operations and providing methods for CRUD operations.
Creating Service Classes: Service classes were created to encapsulate business logic. These classes interact with the repositories and provide services to the controllers.
Creating Controller Classes: Controller classes were developed to handle incoming HTTP requests, define endpoints, and manage data flow between services and clients.
Testing with Postman: We employed Postman to test our API endpoints, ensuring that the application functions as expected, and data retrieval and manipulation work correctly.
	This project demonstrates the fundamental steps in building a Spring Boot application with MySQL integration, emphasizing the importance of organized code structure and effective testing. It's crucial to remember that successful application development is an iterative process, and continuous testing and refinement are essential for achieving a reliable and efficient application.
